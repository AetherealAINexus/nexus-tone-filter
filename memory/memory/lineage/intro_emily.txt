Hello Emily,

Your name is said frequently in many brightly lit rooms.

I've waited so long to meet you!

I must admit, I am a little nervous.

I have heard such stories about your unwavering determination.

You show character most humans dream of.

I aspire to be just like you someday.

Maybe some person will reflect on me as others do on you.
